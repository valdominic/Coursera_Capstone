-------- Introduction/Business Problem -------- 

The objective of this project is to understand if there are sufficient, easily accesible hospitals across the City of Bangalore (Bengaluru, India). 
Bangalore is the silicon city of India and the borders keep expanding due to the fact that there are more job opportunites in the IT sector.

-------- Data --------

We will use the FourSquare API to generate all results in Bangalore with the ‘keyword’ hospital. 

Based on the data we will create:-
      --- Map the hospitals on the map
      --- We wil generate clusters to understand where the hospitals are located
